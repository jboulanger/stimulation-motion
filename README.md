The sample is stimulated using electrical pulses at a given frequency and the twitching is monitored using a microscope. The stimulation and the fire TTL signals are recorded using the picoscope in parallel of the image acquisition. Motion can then be quantified using the Quantify_Motion.ijm imagej macro and latency analyzed using the latencyanalysis.m script.
